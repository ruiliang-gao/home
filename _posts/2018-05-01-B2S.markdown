<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Blender2SOFA</span> is a Blender plugin-in that supprts geometry modeling and customization of physical, collision and visual models and export simulation-ready anatomies (simlets) for TIPS surgical simulator. Several hexahedral mesh generating algorithms such as sweeping, mapping have been implemented in Blender2SOFA. This short demo illustrates my newly added grid-based hexahedral mesher as well as the workflow of generating simlets for surgical simulation.

<!-- The new bridging software in TIPS uses Blender exclusively for geometry
modification, starting from basic anatomy created offline; and it extends the graphical
user interface to add annotations that define the simulation behavior of the scene. -->
<!-- at the artist level, where models are combined into scenes of compatible geometry, collision and physics models and default parameters are initialized; and -->
<!-- To summarize, we implemented the following extensions of Blender:
• augmentation of the user interface to annotate geometric models (organs, vessels,
etc.) with tissue behavior and simulation parameters (Figure 4) for numerical softtissue simulation code (co-rotational finite elements, intersection testing, etc.)
• data structures for importing/exporting/storing tetrahedral meshes.
• geometry processing to automatically link objects (see Figure 3).
• automatic extraction of extended Blender data and export to XML format consumable by SOFA for single-click simulation start.
